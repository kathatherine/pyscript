# PyScript

Welcome to the PyScript (work in progress) documentation!

PyScript provides a way for you to run Python code directly in your browser, giving 
anyone the ability to program without infrastructure barriers. Add an interactive 
Python REPL directly to your website, share an interactive dashboard with a colleague 
as an HTML file, or create a client-side Python-powered web application. This documentation 
will show you how.
